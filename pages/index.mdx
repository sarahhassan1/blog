# Sarah Hassan

## Hey, I'm a Software Engineer at Target. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences.

---

    This past Spring, I graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology of Law, Criminology, and Justice. Although this major may appear unrelated to the world of technology, my past experiences have taught me otherwise.

    I am determined, hardworking, and possess a depth of knowledge within various areas of business and technology. I am looking to fuse my passion for IT with Sociology in order to create more equitable solutions for all. This portfolio is built with **Next.js** .
